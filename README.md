# COMP3015-CW2I 

used Visual Studio 2019.

I used Windows 11.

The code uses a Phong vertex shader to render 3 different colour lights affected a plane and a 3d model of a hammer that I made in blender.

A coder can navigate it by using Visual Studio 2019 to open the solution, if they want to find models they should check the media folder and if they want to find the shader code check the shaders folder.

The prototype can load different models by changing the model source.

The build is located in the x64 file, it can be run by double clicking the exe file, all the required models and shaders are stored in folders with the executable.
