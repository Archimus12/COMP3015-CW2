# COMP3015-CW2

I used Visual Studio 2019.

I used Windows 11.

The build is located in the x64 file, it can be run by double clicking the exe file, all the required models and shaders are stored in folders with the executable.

The code uses a Phong vertex shader to render 3 different colour lights.

The scene contains a plane and a 3d model of a staff and pumpkin that I made in blender. Particles are created from the staff and from the projectiles it launches.

Up and down arrow keys move the staff up and down, the right arrow key launches a projectile that destroys the enemy enchanted pumpkin.

A coder can navigate it by using Visual Studio 2019 to open the solution, if they want to find models they should check the media folder and if they want to find the shader code check the shaders folder.

The prototype can load different models by changing the model source.

It builds upon the scene created for coursework 1.

The idea is self generated and was inspired by Halloween asthetics.
